    I decided to use a while loop to iterate through the functions I needed everytime to ensure that the
program ran until the user decided to end the program. Within the while loop, I called multiple functions
in order to fulfill the assignment requirements and I included a check to see when the loop should end.
The check is if the user inputed either quit or q to the terminal.

    I included a class called Data.py. Within the class, there is a constructor and two methods. The 
constructor requires three strings, one called name, one called regexStart, and one called regexEnd.
One method called retName which is needed in the while loop to search. This method returns the 
name of the Data object. The second method takes in a string which is a file path and it is used to
search that file to find the text between the regexStart and regexEnd which is then printed to an
output.txt file.

    Within the loop, I first prompt the user for a question about the companies that I chose, which were
AMD and NVIDIA. Then, I called the functions, "findCompany()". The "findCompany()" function checks the 
question to find the company name and then returns the file path associated with the company's 10-K. 
This is stored in a variable called fileName to be used later and if the company name is
not found in the question, then the fileName is set to NVIDIA by default. If neither company
name is entered, the program assumes that the current company is the one that is being asked about again. 

    Wihtin the loop, the list of Data objects are searched to see if the question contains any of those
objects. If not, then the corresponding output is printed to the terminal and there is no method called. 
If so, then the method printString(fileName) within the Data.py class is called and the corresponding 
output to the terminal is printed. Note that the answer is not printed into the terminal. This is because 
the output from the 10-K files would be too long.

    After going through these functions, the user is prompted once again to enter another question when
The "output.txt" file is saves the questions asked and the answers for each time the program is run.  
When the program is started, it clears the output.txt file and then saves the conversation into the file.

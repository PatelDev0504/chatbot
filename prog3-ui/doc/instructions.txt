When running the program, go into the src folder and then run the python program. You MUST be inside of 
the src folder before running the python program or the paths for the file reader and file writer will
not work as intended.


The questions that you can enter into the program include two parts:
1. the company name
2. the part of the 10-K file

The companies that you can choose from are:
1. AMD
2. NVIDIA
If both company names are given, then it is defaulted into AMD and if no company names are given, then
the program prompts the user into entering a company name.

The parts of the 10-K file that you can choose from are: (only the part within the parenthesis are needed)
1. "all information" or "tell me everything" - returns everything from part 1 to part 4
2. "business background and risks" or "part 1" - returns everything in part 1
3. "operations and disclosures" or "part 2" - returns everything in part 2
4. "company structure" or "part 3" - returns everything in part 3
5. "financial statements" or "part 4" - returns everything in part 4
6. "business" or "item 1" - returns everything in item 1 
7. "risk factors" or "item 1A" - returns everything in item 1A 
8. "properties" or "item 2" - returns everything in item 2
9. "legal proceedings" or "item 3" - returns everything in item 3
10. "mine safety disclosures" or "item 4" - returns everything in item 4
11. "Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" or "item 5" - returns everything in item 5
12. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" or "item 7" - returns everything in item 7
13. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk" or "item 7A" - returns everything in item 7A
14. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" or "item 8" - returns everything in item 8
15. "Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure" or "item 9" - returns everything in item 9
16. "Controls and Procedures" or "item 9A" - returns everything in item 9A
17. "Other Information" or "item 9B" - returns everything in item 9B
18. "Disclosures Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections" or "item 9C" - returns everything in item 9C
19. "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance" or "item 10" - returns everything in item 10
20. "Executive Compensation" or "item 11" - returns everything in item 11
21. "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters" or "item 12" - returns everything in item 12
22. "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence" or "item 13" - returns everything in item 13
23. "Principal Accountant Fees and Services" or "item 14" - returns everything in item 14
24. "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules" or "item 15" - returns everything in item 15
25. "Form 10-K Summary" or "item 16" - returns everything in item 16
If none of these are entered, then the program tells the user that "I could not find an answer."

For both the company name and part of the 10-K file, the order in which they are given within a file and
the capitalization of the words are irrelevant. In addition, the inclusion of other words will not have
an impact on the results as long as the part of the 10-K file is not interrupted. For example, "mine safety disclosures"
would work, but not "mine with safety disclosures". To end the program, the user only needs to type "q" or "quit" to do so. 
Any other input will not end the program.

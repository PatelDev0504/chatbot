Run the program in the terminal. Must be in the src folder before running. The python file that is supposed to be run is chatbot.py.

When asking the chat bot "tell me everything", it gives all the information about one company.

The chat bot assumes that the company that you want to know about is NVIDIA unless specified in the question that you want to know about AMD.
The chat bot also remembers the company that the last question was asked about. It will use the same company if not specified.

The chat bot supports AMD and NVIDIA and includes information about parts 1-4, items 1, 1A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 7A, 8, 9, 9A, 9B, 9C, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
The chat bot also includes statistics on the previous chat sessions.
The chat bot will print longer answers to a file called output.txt stored in the data folder. This file is cleared everytime the chat bot is started.

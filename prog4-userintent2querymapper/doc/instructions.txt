When running the program, go into the src folder and then run the python program. You MUST be inside of 
the src folder before running the python program or the paths for the file reader and file writer will
not work as intended. For this to work, the fuzzywuzzy library has to be installed. To do that, you
can run the pip install command for fuzzywuzzy in the terminal which should download the correct library.

    I decided to write the first assignment in python. Firstly, I researched how to read from and write 
to files. I started the program by prompting the user to choose which company's 10k annual report that 
they want to read. The companies that I am using for this assignment are AMD and NVIDIA so those two 
companies are the only choices that the user is provided with. After the user chooses the company. The 
variable companyName is set. The filename is also set to the correct file in the data folder. Next, the
variable are declared. I chose to declare num_of_words, num_of_chars, num_of_lines, and num_of_parts. 

    This next part of the code is the file reading part. The path of the text file is established in the
constructor for the file reader. The only unique part that is added on is the name of the file. The code 
opens the file with a while loop to iterate through the file line by line. Next the line is split into 
an array of strings by the number of spaces in the line. Then the code updates all the variables. The 
num_of_lines is increased by one. The num_of_chars is increased by the length of the line string. The 
num_of_words is increased by the number of strings in the array, and the num_of_parts is only increased 
if the line contains the phrase "PART ". After iterating through the entire text file, the reader is 
closed.

    Finally, the code writes to a file. It opens the file writer to write in the "output.txt" file in 
the data folder. The file writer outputs the name of the company and then outputs the num_of_chars, the
num_of_lines, the num_of_parts, and the num_of_words all on seperate indented lines. After the file 
writer finished printing, it is closed.
